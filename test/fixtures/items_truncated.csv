263402475,"CANNA THERAPY Cannabis Cream With Full Plant Extract- anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, regenerating and rejuvenating effect","Why hemp cosmetics?

Leave the soft drugs prejudices aside and take a look at cannabis from a different perspective. Despite the notoriety of plant’s reputation, it has proven medicinal and cosmetic qualities. Hemp products are highly valued natural cosmetics. Do you wonder why?

The antiseptic, antibacterial and energizing characteristics of the herb are known to man for centuries. Since ancient times, hemp was widely used against herpes, eczema and various rashes as well as skin problems of any kind.

Hemp seeds are not marijuana seeds

Now is the time to make an important clarification: Hemp seeds are not marijuana seeds, confusing both is common misconception. All types of hemp used in the food, textile and cosmetic industries are specifically cultivated Cannabis crosses generally called industrial hemp. The plant has three major subtypes: Cannabis Sativa, Cannabis Indica and Cannabis Ruderalis. Those designed for everyday use are selected as not to contain (or contain negligible amounts) of the psychoactive substance THC, which is the substance marijuana owes its effect to. It is important to know regarding hemp seed and the seed oil extract, that THC is located in the flowers of the plant not in its seeds.

What makes the hemp oil valuable?

Hemp oil contains more natural essential fatty acids than any other oil extracted from plants in perfect ratio 3:1 - Omega-6: Omega-3. Contains vitamin E which is a natural antioxidant. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is very close in composition to the fat cells in the human body. This makes cannabis extract unique for deep hydration of skin cell structures as our body does not manufacture these acids by itself. Hemp also contains a complex of vitamins A, B, C, D and E, essential to skin care. It provides the skin with effective sun protection during summer, and reduces the effects of cold-warm transition or vice versa during winter.

Hemp oil has an exceptional effect:

Moisturizes the skin and brings it to a new life; makes tan uniform; regenerates cells;
Protects against the harmful effects of the environment - wind, sun, UV rays, pollution.
Has an anti-inflammatory effect. Highly suitable for dry and devitalized skin; with problems such as acne, eczema, psoriasis.

Whom is hemp cosmetics suitable for?

Natural hemp cosmetics in the form of creams and ointments protect the skin cells from the adverse external conditions by taking care of the water preservation in the cells, preventing from premature aging. A great advantage is the delicacy of the cannabis extract, making it suitable for sensitive and allergic skin prone to acne.

Daily use of the hemp cosmetics has primarily a preventive cosmetic function, but has also a favorable effect on some common skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis or acne.

The Canna Therapy cream

The Canna Therapy cream is prepared using advanced technology based on lipophilic-acrylic matrix that reduces irritating emulsifiers. The texture of the Canna Therapy cream is very light, absorbs instantly, does not irritate the skin and leaves no greasy residue. Thanks to its BIO formula, the cream does not contain any petroleum products or animal products, solvents, sulfates, silicones, paragons and artificial colors. Cold pressed hemp oil contains essential fatty acids and gamma-linolenic acid, which takes care of the development of the natural barrier function of the skin.

We have combined the hemp oil carefully with organic unrefined oils from macadamia, almond and rose at a controlled temperature, so as to retain the natural bioactive properties of the oils. Along with the hydrating ingredients such as glycerin, panthenol, valuable natural oils form almond, rose and macadamia the cream is enriched with natural UV filters, protective vitamin E and regenerating and Anti-aging BIO serum. The Canna Therapy cream is suitable for daily care for all skin types, even if very sensitive or problematic skin.


The Canna Therapy cosmetics are unique containing not only hemp oil, but also Cannabis Sativa extract - a source of unsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids and phytosterols, range natural antioxidants, biominerals, vitamins, carotenoids and chlorophylls. Facial cream Canna Therapy has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiallergenic and regenerating effect. The product has positive effects on various dermatitis, atopic eczema, psoriasis and acne. By its nourishing natural ingredients the Canna Therapy cream provides a natural protective film for easily irritated and sensitive skin prone to dryness and cracking. The cream contains vitamin B8 inositol vitamin of youth, vitality and health with superb biostimulating and antioxidant effect.


While Carnosine prevents glycation of proteins and keeps skin &quot;forever young&quot; cyclic pentapeptide and ceramides are involved in the renovation, preservation and hydration of the skin cell structures. The skin becomes smooth, elastic, tight and silky. Anti-age complex gradually smooth out wrinkles, makes tan uniform and ameliorates the skin structure, leaving the skin beautiful and with optimal level of hydration.",2500,12334521,2016-01-11 12:18:28 UTC,1999-09-12 20:21:39 UTC

263505206,Cherry Bowl,"Cherry wood hand turned & finished bowl.  This is a beautiful piece of wood with some lovely character and grain.  It&#39;s finished with oil.

190mm diameter x 45mm high

All of the wood I use for my bowls comes from trees grown in the UK from sustainable sources.  The majority of it comes from my own garden – either trimmings or from trees removed as part of regular management.  Other wood comes from friends and neighbours who have had trees trimmed or removed.  A few bowls are made from wood bought from a supplier of bowl blanks – this is not a source I use any more, not for any environmental or other concerns, simply because I have a very good stock of more local wood now.  For the future I intend that all of the wood I use will be local and that the source and reason for felling will be verifiable.  This provenance is important to me as far too man y trees are felled for no good reason without being replaced.

My bowls are all turned on a lathe and finished by hand.  They are not perfect specimen pieces – they are real pieces of wood complete with marks, knots, cracks, twists and warps.  Many are turned ‘green’ (which means fairly fresh after being cut and still quite wet) and as such will continue to dry and find their final shape for some time yet.  This is a natural process and only adds to the unique character of each individual piece.

They are all finished with either wax or oil, see the in individual descriptions for each bowl.  They are ‘food safe’ for use as fruit bowls but I would not recommend using them to eat from.  They would benefit from the occasional waxing (standard furniture wax is fine) or oiling (walnut oil from the supermarket is good), just a light wipe is fine to keep them looking their best.

Don’t  soak in water (wipe with a damp cloth and dry straight away) and avoid direct sunlight for any extended period.  Do pick them up regularly and hold them, feel them and enjoy them!",2500,12334145,2016-01-11 12:02:54 UTC,1996-02-09 00:46:40 UTC

They are made to order based on the ideas you give me for your personal blanket.  The possibilities are endless as fleece patterns range from solid colors to Disney characters to wildlife animals...prices vary depending on the fleece you choose.  I usually recommend doing either two solid fleece colors or one solid and one pattern.  These blankets are fine quality and I take the time to put great effort into making sure they will last. They are easy to clean via laundry machine.  Sizes range from 4ft blankets to 9 ft. Prices are subject to change based on the size and/or fleece pattern you choose. Message me for inquiries and quotes. If you aren&#39;t sure if the pattern you like exists, message me and I will let you know. $30 is not a fixed price. That is the cheapest blanket I&#39;ve made - it&#39;s a starting price. Blankets may range from $30-60.  These prices may seem high but they cover the cost of supplies.

This little Italian Greyhound is hand-knit using 100% chunky wool yarn, stuffed with 100% poly-fil.   Realistic plastic eyes and hand-embroidered nose.

His torso is about 13&quot; long
Chest is about 5&quot; wide
Top of head to toe is about 19&quot; tall

(NOTE: The stuffed animal will be shipped without any wires or internal framing to keep the legs upright. If you want the animals to be able to stand upright, I would recommend using chopsticks as splints.)

3D printed and lost wax cast in solid sterling silver.

This pendant is 1-1/2 inches tall (4 cm)

Seahorse is the name given to 54 species of small marine fishes in the genus Hippocampus. &quot;Hippocampus&quot; comes from the ancient Greek word hippos meaning &quot;horse&quot; and kampos meaning &quot;sea monster&quot;. Seahorses sport a segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile tail.

The short-snouted seahorse (Hippocampus hippocampus) is a species of seahorse in the family Syngnathidae. It is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea and parts of the North Atlantic, particularly around Italy and the Canary Islands. Colonies of the species have recently been discovered in the River Thames around London. Their preferred habitat is shallow muddy waters, estuaries or seagrass beds.
